============
INTRODUCTION
============

The tahoefs program is a FUSE interface implementation written in C
language for the Tahoe-LAFS filesystem.


==========
LIMITATION
==========

At this moment, the implementation only support reading files and
directories.  No write operations are supported.


==============
HOW TO COMPILE
==============

Install necessary libraries.  The program depends on the following
libraries.

- FUSE library (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)
- CURL library (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
- JSON library (http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/)

If you are using MacOS X and using macports, just typing the following
command will be sufficient.

  # port install macfuse json-c

If you are using Linux, then probably following command will help you.

  # aptitude install libfuse-dev libcurl-dev libjson0-dev libattr1-dev

You also need to set the user_xattr mount option on your filesystem if
you are using Linux to support extended file attributes to store
Tahoe-LAFS metadata with local cache files.

Retrieve a copy of the tahoefs project from the repository.

   $ git clone git://github.com/keiichishima/tahoefs.git

Go to the tahoefs directory and just typing make will build the
program.


=====
USAGE
=====

Before using the tahoefs program, you must install and run a
Tahoe-LAFS client system on your host, since the tahoefs program use
the web-API server running locally.  For detailed instruction of how
to install and run a Tahoe-LAFS client, please read the installation
manual distributed with the Tahoe-LAFS program.

After started running your Tahoe-LAFS client, create 'tahoe' alias
using the tahoe program, if you don't have it yet.  The tahoe program
is a python script distributed with the original Tahoe-LAFS package.
The 'tahoe' alias is the default root directory of the tahoefs program
when no command line option is specified.  For example, the following
command will create the 'tahoe' alias.

  $ tahoe create-alias tahoe

Once you have set up your Tahoe-LAFS client, create a mount point
somewhere in your local filesystem, and type as follows.

  $ tahoefs MOUNTPOINT

If everything goes well, you can now access your Tahoe-LAFS directory
under the MOUNTPOINT directory.

There are some command line options to change the behavior of the
tahoefs program.  Providing the '-h' option to the tahoefs program
will show you available options.

TODO

- make cache management smarter.
- support offline operation.
